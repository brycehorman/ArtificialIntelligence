This repository contains files for my first project, which involves different variations on the A* pathfinding algorithm. For each variation, a random grid is generated with a start and an end destination and the algorithm finds a path from the start to the end. It is written in python.

To run in command line: python (name of implementation).py (number of iterations)
ex: python AdaptiveAStar.py 100
